how i made this website??

# code
i used visual studio code and implemented css,javascript in my html file to create the website.

# images
i used postimg to post the images for like 7 days (u can also use the no expiration option if u want ur images to last!!), copied the url
and inserted them in the src

# how to public it?
i used vercel to deploy my repository and it gave me a public domain!! (all free), you have to create the repository on github with all the files,copy the link
to the repository,sign up to vercel with your github account and then paste the url to deploy everything!!

# credits
if u want to take inspo,use my code and change something or anything like that,please give credits <3
